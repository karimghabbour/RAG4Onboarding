# AI Community Project: HPE BCN Virtual Buddy
Executive Summary 

Project Title: Onboarding Virtual Buddy  

Objective: 

Use AI hands-on within the community to learn and add value to the Barcelona hub. 

Provide continuous support to newcomers, bridging knowledge gaps post onboarding. 

Proactively enhance the onboarding process by using real time feedback to adjust the curriculum. 

 

The Problem 

Many newcomers realize there’s a lot they don’t know only after starting their real job, as many questions only arise on the job and can't be addressed during onboarding. Onboarding instructors, while ready to answer questions, don't see what people really struggle with after they start. Although every newcomer is assigned a buddy, this buddy also has their own job and might not have all the answers. A virtual buddy, however, can provide continuous support and have comprehensive knowledge, specifically tailored to the needs of the Barcelona hub. This will help bridge the knowledge gap that often remains after the initial onboarding process. 

 

The Solution 

The solution is to develop a virtual buddy that provides instant access to essential HPE information, ensuring continuous support and filling knowledge gaps post onboarding. This virtual buddy will offer a range of resources tailored specifically to the Barcelona hub, including sales tools, product knowledge, and sales training. It will also provide insights into the available communities and resources within the Barcelona hub, keeping users informed about events and important information. Additionally, the virtual buddy will list key contacts at the hub, including subject matter experts, and offer comprehensive details about the hub's various communities, resource groups, and initiatives. This targeted approach ensures that newcomers at the Barcelona hub have all the support and information they need, right at their fingertips. 

 

Feedback Cycle 

The virtual buddy analyzes queries to reveal the real-time challenges that newcomers face once they start their jobs. As more people use the chatbot, it helps identify missing information that wasn’t covered during onboarding. Onboarding instructors can then adjust their curriculum based on this data, ensuring that users receive the information they need while also improving the onboarding process. This dual benefit creates a feedback loop that continuously improves the onboarding experience. By addressing the actual challenges encountered post onboarding, the Barcelona hub ensures that new hires are better supported and more effectively integrated into their roles.
