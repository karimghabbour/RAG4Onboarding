Day 1
● Did the manager add you as buddy in Workday?
● Reach out to the new hire to get the relationship started and set up a meeting
with the new hire on Day 1 (if possible), or the next day.
● For a warm and personal introduction, meet with the new hire in person on
Day 1. Usually we all meet on the groundfloor (managers, newcomers and
buddies) to have breakfast togethter. As a general rule the manager will pick
up the newcomer in the reception at 8:45 and then we all meet at 9:00.
● Introduce facilities such as reception, PC support, Shipping, Mayordomo,
Cafeteria etc.
● Guiding them through the hpe.home.com and highlighting sites they might
need in their role, such as EEM (for expenses) and eetime.
● Taking the new hire to lunch, or joining the manager for lunch with the new
hire
● Telling them about the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) in the Barcelona
Center, such as YEN, Toastmasters, External Engagement etc.
● Making introductions so they can start to build their network
What to do as a buddy
1. First thing to do is to go through the checklists that everyone is asked to do as
a newcomer to HPE. The checklists are available in this document as well.
2. Be clear on the ownership and the engagement, both from buddy and
newcomer. The newcomer should be proactive in informing and asking
questions. The buddy should be supportive and make sure to block time in the
calendar to do buddy actions. Please look under "buddy time tab" to see good
moments for doing it. Any changes should be communicated to buddy by the
newcomer.
3. When the newcomer is preparing for one of the "Refresh Session" be of help
to formulate the right question. After the session you can help to apply what
was learned.
4. Onboarding buddies show a positive attitude about their job, the company,
and being an orientation partner.
5. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions! Think about your own doubt when
you first started.
6. Be willing and eager to spend time and energy making your new colleague's
initial experience a positive one.
7. Use your knowledge of the site/ organization/ business unit/division to help
the newhire settle in quickly.
8. Finally, a buddy needs to have the time to work with the new hire. Work with
your manager to understand the time investment and other expectations
he/she may have.
